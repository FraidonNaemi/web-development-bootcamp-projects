      <p class="first-paragraph">
        Nahj al-balāgha (Arabic: نهج البلاغة) (the Peak of Eloquence) is a collection of sayings and writings of Imam 'Ali (a) which have been compiled by al-Sayyid al-Radi in late 4th/10th century (finished in 400/1009-10).
        The criterion for selecting the sayings has been the eloquence of speech. The eloquence in this compilation is at such a high level that even though al-Sayyid al-Radi was a great poet and distinguished man of literature and had great works, regarded this compilation an honor for himself.

        Al-Ṣaḥīfa al-Sajjādīyya (Arabic:الصَّحيفَة السَّجَّادية) is a book containing Imam al-Sajjad's 54 supplications and du'as.
        After the Qur'an and Nahj al-balagha, this book has an important position among the Shi'a school of thought and is known as "Zabur Al Muhammad" (the Psalms of the Family of Muhammad (s)) and "Injil Ahl al-Bayt (a)" (the Gospel of the Household of the Prophet (s)). <br> <br>
        Note: Imam al-Sajjad is the fourth Imam of Shia school.
